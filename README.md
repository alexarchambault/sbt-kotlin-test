## sbt mixed Scala / Kotlin project

Based on <https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/SCL-23032/Kotlin-companion-object-methods-are-not-resolved-from-Scala>

Code navigation from Scala to Kotlin seems to be working fine, using non-"experimental" BSP import
(using `IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 EAP (Ultimate Edition), Build #IU-243.16718.32, built on September 26, 2024`)
